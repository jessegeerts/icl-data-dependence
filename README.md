# icl-data-dependence
Code to replicate Gautam Reddy's "The mechanistic basis of data dependence and abrupt learning in an in-context classification task." (ICLR 2024). 

Note: this code uses [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/) for logging. It assumes that there is a file called `definitions.py` which specifies a variable `WANDB_KEY`. You can get your WandB key by making a WandB account.
